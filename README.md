Ideas
=====

- Option for ip's will not work here. It should also be a config per index/type entry. Like an array of id's
- for backup config you could provide a query per index/type
- creating zip files when zip extension is enabled and also ask for deleting directory after created zip
- backup store aliases if set on backuped indices
- command: explore backups with showing meta data
- command: backup:config should create a config file only and stores somewhere
